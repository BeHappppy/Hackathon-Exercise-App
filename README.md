- There will be a graph that will show their "weekly report" based on the last 7 days (techniqly not weekly since it will start the day they registor) where they can see how close they were from the daily goal throughout the week. If, at the end of the week they always hit there goal then the graph will show it (With a motivational comment about how good they did, of course)


- A check list where they check off workouts as they do them. So they can break down their daily goal into bite sized chunks so they can get them done without stressing about doing them all at one time

- A page where they could edit there daily goal and change how many / what type of workouts they do in a day (I.e. get rid of a 30 min run in favor of a 30 min jog)
